# SPDCK
### (Pronounced es-pee-deck)
Control your Spotify Playback from the SteamOS Quick Access Menu.<br>
Built using [SteamOS Plugin Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader).
### Why the weird name?
Because Spotify doesn't allow anything sounding even remotely close to the word Spotify. Not that it really matters.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have [Steamdeck Pluginloader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader#installation) installed
2. Download/`git clone` this repo into the `/home/deck/homebrew/plugins` folder on your Steam Deck
3. Have a spotify client running (on your PC, on the deck, on your phone, etc)
4. Access the plugins in the quick access menu and select Spdck
5. Click the login button and authorize the app, then start using it
